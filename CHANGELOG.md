## [2.1.0-beta] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Fixed adapter xcframework builds failing with "duplicate interface definition" when CloudXCore is a dynamic framework dependency (added SKIP_INSTALL=YES to CloudXCore podspec)

### Changed
- Removed dead ENABLE_BITCODE=NO settings from all adapter Podfiles and build scripts (bitcode was removed by Apple in Xcode 14)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-04

This release replaces placement names with **Ad Unit IDs** from the CloudX dashboard. Update your `createBannerWithAdUnitId:`, `createMRECWithAdUnitId:`, `createInterstitialWithAdUnitId:`, and `createRewardedWithAdUnitId:` calls to use the ad unit ID instead of a placement name.

### Added
- Rewarded ads with `createRewardedWithAdUnitId:delegate:` and `CLXRewardedDelegate`
- InMobi adapter (SDK 11.1) with support for banner, MREC, interstitial, and rewarded ads
- `CLXAd.networkPlacement` property for network-specific placement ID

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `placement` parameter to `adUnitId` in `createBannerWithAdUnitId:`, `createMRECWithAdUnitId:`, `createInterstitialWithAdUnitId:`, `createRewardedWithAdUnitId:`
- Renamed `CLXAd.placement` to `adUnitId`
- Renamed `CLXAd.bidderName` to `networkName`
- Renamed `CLXErrorCodeInvalidPlacement` to `CLXErrorCodeInvalidAdUnit`
- Changed `bannerAdView:didFailWithError:` to include ad unit ID in error
- Removed `testMode` parameter from `initializeSDKWithAppKey:completion:` - test mode is now server-controlled via dashboard

### Changed
- Meta Audience Network SDK updated from 6.17.0 to 6.21.0
- Vungle SDK updated from 7.4.2 to 7.6.0
